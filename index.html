    <h1>Nihar Bhardwaj Darbhamulla</h1>
    <p> 
        I am Nihar, an incoming PhD student at the Numerical Linear Algebra group at University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I will
        be working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~greif/" target="_blank">Dr. Chen Greif</a> on pre-conditioning linear systems for iterative
        solvers. My research intersts lie at the intersection of Numerical Linear Algebra and Numerical Methods for Coupled PDEs.
    </p>

    <p>
        I completed my Master's degree at the <a href="https://cml.mech.ubc.ca/" target="_blank"> Computational Multiphysics Laboratory</a> under the supervision of 
        <a href="https://mech.ubc.ca/rajeev-jaiman/" target="_blank"> Dr. Rajeev Jaiman</a> . As a master's
        student, I was involved with the development of an in-house code for coupling the interaction of flexible structures with cavitating fluid flows. 
        The solver suite was developed with the objective of evaluating cavitation characteristics of marine propellers and enhancing passive morphing
        based design strategies.

        Previously, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, where I was associated with the development
        of an Immersed Boundary flow solver. I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology 
        Guwahati.
