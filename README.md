# Nihar Bhardwaj Darbhamulla

My research interests lie at the intersection of Numerical Methods for PDEs, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Numerical Linear Algebra. I possess 4 years of research experience in developing, maintaining and deploying CFD codes tailored to Fluid-Structure interaction and multiphysics applications. 

I hold MASc and B.Tech degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of British Columbia and Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati respectively. My experiences include a research internship with ANSYS Inc. under the MITACS Accelerate program and a Junior Research Fellowship at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
